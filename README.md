# Overview

This game is a simple arcade style game where the goal is to reunite the heart and the soul. To play, use W, A, S, and D to go up, left, down, and right respectively. Shadow being enemies will spawn to try to stop you from reuniting the heart and soul and the more you allow to spawn and evade around the screen, the higher the score is; So you don't want to reunite the heart and soul too quickly; See how high you can get the score!

I developed this game to learn about Pygame and express my creativity. I had heard a lot about Pygaeme and wanted to give a use to the Heart and Soul cover loop that I made a while back!

# Future Work

There are features that I want to improve and implement in the future:

- Different soul characters! My artistic skills are not on the level required to make anything look like a great and shaded character. I generated 2d images through AI and colored them to look like spirits but making them look the way I wanted was proving more difficult than expected. So I'd like to do more research on how to make the characters stand out more and look better.
- I want to add sound effects to the characters and the win/lose screen.
- I want to add more personality to the menu screens instead of just making them white screens with words. I want to learn how to animate the text and make things pop a little more with shadows and not look so 2D.
